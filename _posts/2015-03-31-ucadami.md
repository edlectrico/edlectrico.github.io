role: Among other tasks, I took part in this project through the extration of user capabilities by measuring several implicit interaction boundaries; the design, implementation and evaluation of an ontology which models the functional capabilities of the user; the analysis and evaluation of context models and ontologies to be included in the design; the design and implemenation of an inference engine which considers both environmental conditions and their impact in the final application; and so forth.

The aim of the UCADAMI project is to research in the creation of a technological framework that allows the dynamic adaptation of user interface based on the user and the context of use of interactive digital content consumed through mobile devices and its evaluation through data analysis and experimentation with users. This will require to: define user models that include their characteristics; create context recognition systems to automatically collect information as far as possible; define data models which retrieve the activity and the impact of the content in the user with the aim of achieving a better experience for all users through a universal, accessible and inclusive way for everybody.
