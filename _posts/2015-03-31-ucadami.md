The aim of the UCADAMI project is to research in the creation of a technological framework that allows the dynamic adaptation of user interface based on the user and the context of use of interactive digital content consumed through mobile devices and its evaluation through data analysis and experimentation with users. This will require to: define user models that include their characteristics; create context recognition systems to automatically collect information as far as possible; define data models which retrieve the activity and the impact of the content in the user with the aim of achieving a better experience for all users through a universal, accessible and inclusive way for everybody.
