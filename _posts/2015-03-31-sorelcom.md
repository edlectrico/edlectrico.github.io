role: In this project I have been envolved as Project Manager. Through this position I have helped in the requisites collection process and in the whole platform design. Besides, I've carried out most of the semantic modelling and representation of the necessary knowledge involved in the project, including users, routes, planifications, and so on.

The main objective of SORELCOM is to provide a framework which will allow users to share and search cycle routes based on context data and impartial/unbiased information which will help to classify the current route. This classification will allow to find those routes which best fit the characteristics of the current user. SORELCOM will provide a website in which the user will be able to manage the produced data, and also a mobile application, through which the user will generate the corresponding information of the routes.
