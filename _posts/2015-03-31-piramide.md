role: Among other tasks, I participated in PIRAmIDE by evaluating the Imhotep framework, which is focused on easing the development of adaptive user interfaces. This evaluation was performed through the AssistedCity demonstrator. AssistedCity is a guiding application which helps users to reach to the POIs that they're interested in using the Augmented Reality paradigm. This application was developed using Imhotep, and several experiments were carried out to validate Imhotep.

The PIRAmIDE project proposes to use user mobile device as a catalizer of the interaction of users with their environment, acting as a sixth sence which aids and assists us facilitating and improving our daily interactions with the objects that surround us in our workplace, home or public administrations.
