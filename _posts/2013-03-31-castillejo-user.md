Personalization and self-customizable environments tend to increase user satisfaction. There are many approaches to face the problem of designing adaptive user interface systems. However, most of the reviewed solutions are very domain dependent. We identify users, context and devices as the most significant entities in adaptive user interface domains. This paper digs into several drawback related to these environments, remarking the incongruity and aggregation of context, and the entities interaction within adaptive user interfaces domains.
