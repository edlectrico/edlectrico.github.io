Adaptive user interfaces involves the design of dynamic interfaces whose main purpose is to present an adapted alternative to the user to ease the interaction. User’s preferences, context situation and device’s capabilities help these systems to adapt the interface to make the interaction more adequate to the current situation. Being aware of different characteristics of these entities is vital for reaching the main goals of these systems efficiently. To collect knowledge from these entities, it is necessary to design several formal models to help to organize and give meaning to the gathered data. In this paper, we analyse several literature solutions for modelling users, context and devices considering different approaches. We identify their advantages and drawbacks to finally propose a new ontology model which addresses the identified limitations.
