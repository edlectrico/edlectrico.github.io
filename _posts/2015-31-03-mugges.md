The MUGGES project focuses on services between mobile devices. It will develop basic components and market-ready mobile applications, in order to enable the provision, remote discovery and access of information from one mobile device directly (P2P) to another mobile device. The MUGGES project proposes the usage of GNSS Technology as the main driver of the mobile user-generated social-service paradigm, which represents a very clear current trend of business innovation.
