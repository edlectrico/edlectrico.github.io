As the device ecosystem in the intelligent environments becomes more complex, the need for supporting a wider range of devices becomes crucial. To address this challenge, this paper describes a framework, Imhotep, which can be used to develop mobile applications, easily adapting them to the constraints imposed by the user and device capabilities through a set of preprocessor directives. These directives are enhanced with concepts that are automatically adjusted to the current trends of mobile devices by using a fuzzy knowledge-eliciting reasoner.
