Hi! My name is Eduardo Castillejo, I'm a Research Assistant in the Internet unit at the [MORElab - Envisioning Future Internet](http://www.morelab.deusto.es) research group at [DeustoTech – Deusto Institute of Technology](http://www.deustotech.deusto.es), at the [University of Deusto](http://www.deusto.es). I've been working in this group since 2008 taking part in some local, national and European research projects (PIRAmIDE, ACROSS, THOFU, DYNUI, MUGGES...) and different proposals. I have collaborated with other research projects, like mCiudad and [Zebra Crossing (ZXing)](https://github.com/zxing/zxing") (see the official announcement [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/zxing/HAirjcA9CeY)). Besides, I have taken active part in many scientific publications related with these research projects.
