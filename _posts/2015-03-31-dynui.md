The aim of DYNUI is to define an intelligent platform that facilitates the development and deployment of user-environment interfaces adaptable to the users, their interaction devices and their context. These interfaces have to be adapted both at the beginning and during the execution of services taking into account the users' capacities, their interaction devices and the users' and their environment's current context.
