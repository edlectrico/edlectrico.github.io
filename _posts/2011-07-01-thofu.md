role: In the THOFU project I developed a specific and efficient location system which, applying several mathematical techniques and models (e.g. Bayes) the position of the user in the hotel was determined through a data fusion process (the location information came from different sources). Besides, a user activity classifier was implemented in Java using the corresponding binaries from Weka.

THOFU is a large multidisciplinary R&D project which aims to enhance the offer of the hospitality sector through joint research on a new conception of the future hotel, from the spaces and their construction, to objects that reside in it, the interaction with guests, as well as the symbiosis with the Internet.
