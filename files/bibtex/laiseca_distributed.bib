	abstract = {The increase of life expectancy has arisen new challenges related with the amount of resources required to attend elderly people with cognitive disabilities. These requirements, such as medical staff and financial resources, have been multiplied in the last years, and this tendency will continue in the forthcoming ones. In order to reduce these requirements, the introduction of new technologies will be a key aspect. In this paper we propose a test-question-based memory game that collects the answers given by patients and facilitates access to this information to caregivers and relatives.},
