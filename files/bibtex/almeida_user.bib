	abstract = {The adoption of {ICT} assistive technologies by elderly and disable collectives has been slow and unsatisfactory. However, a bigger adoption could contribute to their independent living significantly. As the average age of the population increases in the most developed countries, this becomes an unavoidable problem. To tackle this problem, this paper devises a framework that facilitates the process of creating interfaces that adapt themselves to the specific capabilities of each user. Furthermore a Fuzzy Knowledge-Eliciting Reasoner is proposed that infers new capabilities from the existing ones. Using this reasoning engine, developers can use more natural concepts when stating the code adaptation directives.},
